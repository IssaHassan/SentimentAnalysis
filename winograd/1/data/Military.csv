"On September 17th 2006 The Government of Israel decided, under section 8A of The Government Act 2001, to appoint a governmental commission of examination “To look into the preparation and conduct of the political and the security levels concerning all the dimensions of the Northern Campaign which started on July 12th 2006”.  ",1
"Therefore we decided to publish initially an Interim Report, focusing on the decisions related to starting the war.
",1
"The core of the interim report is a detailed examination of the decisions of 
senior political and military decision-makers concerning the decision to go to war at the wake of the abduction of the two soldiers on the morning of July 12th.",0
"We  start with the decision of the government on the fateful evening of the 12th.to authorize a sharp military response, and end with the speech of the Prime Minister in the Knesset on July 17th, when he officially presented the campaign and its goals",0
"The  decision to respond with an immediate, intensive military strike was not
 based on a detailed, comprehensive and authorized military plan, based on carefull study of the complex characteristics of the Lebanon arena",0
"The ability to achieve military gains having significant political-international
 weight was limited; an Israeli military strike would inevitably lead to missiles fired at the Israeli civilian north;  there was not other effective military response to such missile attacks than an extensive and prolonged ground operation to capture the areas from which the missiles were fired  – which would have a high “cost” and which did not enjoy broad support. ",0
"Consequently, in making the decision to go to war, the government did not
 consider the whole range of options, including that of continuing the policy of ‘containment’, or combining political and diplomatic moves with military strikes below the ‘escalation level’, or military preparations without immediage military action -- so as to maintain for Israel the full range of responses to the abduction.  ",0
"The IDF did not exhibit creativity in proposing alternative action possibilities,
 did not alert the political decision-makers to the discrepancy between its own scenarios and the authorized modes of action,  and did not demand  – as was necessary under its own plans – early mobilization of the reserves so they could be equipped and trained in case a ground operation would be required.  ",0
The  army and the COS were not prepared for the event of the abduction despite recurring alerts.,0
"When the abduction happened, he responded impulsively",0
"He did not alert the political leaders to the complexity of the situation, and did 
not present information, assessments and plans that were available in the IDF at various levels of planning and approval and which would have enabled a better response to the challenges.",0
"The  ability of Hezbollah to sit ‘on the border’, its ability to dictate the moment 
of escalation, and the growth of its military abilities and missile arsenal increased significantly as a result of Israel’s unilateral withdrawal in May 2000 (which was not followed, as had been hoped, by The Lebanese Army deploying on the border with Israel.  ",0
"The shortcomings in the preparedness and the training of the army,
 its operational doctrine, and various flaws in its organizational culture and structure, were all the responsibility of the military commanders and political leaders in charge years before the present Prime Minister, Minister of Defense and Chief of Staff took office.  ",0
